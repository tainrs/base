## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

### Installation

To build the Docker image locally, clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tainrs/base.git
cd base
docker build -t base-image .
```

Alternatively, you can use the `build.sh` script to build the image:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tainrs/base.git
cd base
./build.sh amd64
```

### Usage

You can use this base image as the starting point for your Docker projects. Hereâ€™s an example of a `Dockerfile` that extends this base image:

```Dockerfile
FROM base-image

# Install additional packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    vim

# Set up your application
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

# Run the application
CMD ["./run.sh"]
```

Build your custom image using:

```bash
docker build -t custom-image .
```

## Configuration

The base image can be customized by modifying the `Dockerfile` in this repository. You can add or remove packages, change environment variables, and configure other settings to suit your needs.
